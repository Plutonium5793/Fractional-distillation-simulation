# Fractional distillation simulation
Uses the clausius-clapeyron equation to simulate the fractional distillation of up to 6 components.  Creates files of the results including 2 files to plot the results in gnuplot.  The simulation is written in FreeBasic, and includes a database of ~220 solvents which can be used.  Included here will be sample output files for a distillation of 15 ml of benzene, 15 ml of toluene, and 15 ml of benzonitrile using a 15cm glass helices column.  Programmed in Freebasic.
